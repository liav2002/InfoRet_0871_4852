DCPS = Data Cleaned from Punctuations and Stop-words.

Here we should be 3 json files:

1. on dcps_A.json: {key = file_id, value = vector of document using w2v).
2. on dcps_B.json: {key = file_id, value = vector of document using w2v).
3. on dcps_C.json: {key = file_id, value = vector of document using w2v).

And 3 xlsx files:

1. dcps_A_vec.xlsx - matrix for group A.
2. dcps_B_vec.xlsx - matrix for group B.
3. dcps_C_vec.xlsx - matrix for group C.
